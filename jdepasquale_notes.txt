Floats are demonstrated here:

nav bar (all pages) 
 - index.html line 12
 - css/rs.css line 63
aside (all pages)
 - index.html line 41
 - css/rs.css line 105
album artwork (front, back)
 - index.html lines 30,31
 - css/rs.css lines 147, 153

Positioning is demonstrated here:

The footer uses fixed positioning to keep it at the bottom of the window (all pages)
 - index.html line 45
 - css/rs.css line 237
The site uses jQuery and JS to keep the nav bar fixed at the top when the user scrolls the window past the header
(all pages). 
 - js/sticky-nav.js
 - css/rs.css line 86 (class "scrolled" is tied to the scroll point of the window)

The 3 CSS techniques I used on the site are:

 1. Web fonts: html-header.html line 4, css/rs.css line 19
 2. Rounded corners: css/rss.css line 126
 3. Gradients: css/rss.css line 246 (for the footer)

My table is contained in dates-table.html which is linked as a server-side include in shows.html. 
 - the table is formatted for accessibility using ARIA roles to denote column and row headers.
